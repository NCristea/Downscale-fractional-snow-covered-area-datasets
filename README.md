# Downscale-fractional-snow-covered-area-datasets
This is a Matlab-based tool to downscale fractional snow covered area products (e.g. 500-m MODIS) 
and derive high resolution snow presence/absence grids. 
The example included, "run_downscale.m" script is applied to a 500-m fSCA data for the Mt. Rainier area, WA to 
downscale to 30-m resolution
